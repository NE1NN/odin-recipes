        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Water</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low, and let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes.</li>
